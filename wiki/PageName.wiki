= Introduction =

mfm-simulation project evaluates "Magnetic field model" (MFM) being proposed in IWSON2.  Workshop program : http://www.iswcs2012.org/images/IWSONII_Program_120828.pdf.  In future the project would be maintained and much more simulation, demonstration of MFM will be done as part of this project.  Contributors are welcome!!! please email to me @ premnathkn@ieee.org

= Details =

*Activities done:*
# Code base made available to public (in the current form).
# Short Abstract and initial wiki ready.

*Current ongoing activities:*
# Introducing MFM algorithm in the tool.
# Viewing the MFM iteration results.

*Technology used:*
# Primilarly java.
# Log4J is used for logging.

*Next steps:*
*  provide manual development environment configuration.  Until then "just import the project in eclipse with workspace mfm-simulation" and use JDK 1.6.  Run myMFM.java as a Java application.  That's it.
*  Introduce, integrate Spring & convert all sigletons to sprint services.
*  Maven integration
*  Continious integration environment.
*  Code clarity and checkstyle recommendations.
*  Much more....
